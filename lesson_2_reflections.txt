What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It adds a .git document to the folder where all history data will be saved. But it wont create automatically a commit because you have to name every commit with a small name wich cant be done automatically.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area gives you te possibility to write more than one one logical change and separate them into 2 diffrent commits while adding them after another to the staging area and commit them.
