When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working in a team or on more than one devices.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because you maybe dont want to be disturbed by any other changes to your project.
